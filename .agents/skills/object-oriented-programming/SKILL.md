# Object Oriented Programming

One skill covering the full OOP review/design lens: whether something should be a class at all, SOLID, GoF
patterns, Tell Don't Ask, and Object Calisthenics. Don't recite theory — point at the specific line, name the
violation, propose the concrete refactor.

**Core rule:** Use a class only when it creates multiple instances with their own state. Otherwise prefer
functions, object literals, or types. — Dave Thomas

## Step 0 — Should this even be a class?

Before applying any other rule, run new or reviewed code through this first:

1. Does it hold instance state (remembers things between method calls)? → No: skip to utility-object check.
2. Will it be instantiated more than once with different state? → No: continue below, it's probably not a class.
3. Is it a collection of static methods? → convert to standalone functions / `const X = {...} as const`.
4. Does it have exactly one public method (`perform`/`call`/`execute`/`run`)? → convert to a function.
5. Is it invalid immediately after construction (needs setters before use)? → take all required args at once.
6. Is it named after a design pattern (Decorator/Factory/Strategy/Command)? → consider composition/functions/HOFs.
7. Is it a pure data class (constructor + properties, no behavior)? → use a `type`/`interface` + object literal.
8. None of the above? → ✅ legitimately a class. Now apply SOLID, Tell Don't Ask, and (optionally) Calisthenics below.

## SOLID — quick reference

| Principle | Rule                                              | Signal it's violated                                                       | Fix                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SRP**   | One reason to change                              | Class handles auth, hashing, and persistence                               | Split into `Validator` / `Hasher` / `Repository`                                       |
| **OCP**   | Extend via subclass; don't modify proven code     | Adding a new format requires editing the existing formatter                | Add a subclass without touching the base                                               |
| **LSP**   | Subtypes substitutable without surprising callers | `instanceof` checks in calling code; subclass throws "not supported"       | Split into separate interfaces instead of one class hierarchy that only partially fits |
| **ISP**   | Many focused interfaces over one fat one          | Read-only client forced to implement write methods                         | Slice the fat interface by capability                                                  |
| **DIP**   | Depend on abstractions, not concretions           | A service directly instantiates a concrete client (`new SendgridClient()`) | Inject an interface/abstract transport instead                                         |

## Design patterns — quick selector

| Problem                                          | Pattern              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| One shared instance (DB, config, logger)         | **Singleton**        |
| Swap algorithms at runtime                       | **Strategy**         |
| Create families of related objects               | **Abstract Factory** |
| Create objects without naming the concrete class | **Factory**          |
| Construct complex objects step-by-step           | **Builder**          |
| Pair a type and utility object under one name    | **Companion Object** |
| Notify subscribers on state change               | **Observer**         |
| Add cross-cutting behavior non-invasively        | **Decorator**        |
| Intercept/validate/log property access           | **Proxy**            |
| Share behavior across unrelated classes          | **Mixin**            |
| Reuse instances to reduce memory                 | **Flyweight**        |
| Decouple via a central hub                       | **Mediator**         |

When answering a pattern question, cover: what it is (1 sentence), when to use / not use, a minimal runnable
TypeScript example, trade-offs, and any TS-specific caveat (e.g. standard vs `experimentalDecorators`).

open recursion, delegation, structural polymorphism, simulating `final`): `references/patterns.md`

## Tell, Don't Ask

Don't let callers query an object's state and decide externally — move the decision into the object. Red flags:
getter chains used to make a decision, `if (obj.getX() > obj.getLimit())` outside the class, `get` then `set` in
sequence from the caller. Legitimate exceptions: DTOs, value objects, serialization/persistence boundaries, and
query methods that genuinely transform data for the caller — don't be a "getter eradicator."

## Object Calisthenics (stricter pass)

Once class-shape, SOLID, and Tell Don't Ask are clean, Jeff Bay's 9 rules (one indent level per method, no
`else`, wrap primitives, first-class collections, one dot per line, no abbreviations, small entities, ≤2 instance
variables, no bare getters/setters) push further. Apply as a lens during deliberate refactor passes or when the
user explicitly wants a more disciplined review — not as a default blocking gate.

## Testing implications

| Pattern            | Setup            | Testing            |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Pure functions     | Pass args        | Isolated, no mocks |
| Stateful classes   | Factories, mocks | Tangled            |
| Inheritance chains | Heavy fixtures   | Nightmare          |
